Extension of the OCaml standard library
=======================================

This library is a light-weight extension of the OCaml standard library.

To use it, simply use the following.
```ocaml
open Stdlib_extra.Extra
```
This has the effect of making available the contents of the prelude (module
`Stdlib_extra.Prelude`) as well as aliases for extended standard library
modules.
